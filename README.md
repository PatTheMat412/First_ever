# First ever project
This is the first ever Kaggle competition that I participated in. This notebook has not been altered at all since I submitted it a couple months ago. I want to keep this in my github, definitely not because its good, but because it was my first foray into data science / machine learning. I look forward to looking back on this project and seeing how far I have come. 

# Overview
- The main objetive of the project was to determine, based on a few statistics about a person, whether they survived after the titanic hit the Iceberg.
